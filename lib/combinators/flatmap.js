 * Map a function over every element of a list and concatenate the results

 * @example
 * const f = x => [x, x];
 * const xs = [1, 2];
 * flatmap(f, xs).then(console.log); // Prints [1, 1, 2, 2];
 *
 * @param {Function.<*>} f The function that is applied to every element. This
 * function can either return a value or the promise for a value.
 * @param {(Promise.<Array>|Array.<*>)} xs The list to map `f` over. This can
 * either be an array, or the promise for an array.
 * @returns {Promise.<Array>} The concatenation of applying every element of
 * `xs` to `f`.
