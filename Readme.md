    or a promise for a value.

**Examples**

```javascript
const f = constant("Hello");
f().then(console.log); // Returns "Hello"
```

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)&lt;any>** A promise that resolves to `x`.

### fmap

Map a function over a promise.

    either be a value or a promise that resolves to a value.

    of `f`. This can either be a value, or a promise that resolves to a value.
-   `y` **([Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)&lt;any> | any)** A value that gets lifted as the first argument

`y`.

### flatmap

the value is an array, flatten it to the formal parameters of the
fulfillment handler.

### flow

Create a function out of a list of functions, where each successive
invocation is supplied the return value of the previous function call. The
new function forms a pipe where the results flow from left to right so to
speak. It's a shortcut for composing more than two functions.

**Parameters**

    compose. `fs` can either be an array, or a promise that resolves to an
    array. Each function can either return a value or a promise for a value.
-   `x` **([Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) | any)** The argument to call the function pipeline with. It
    can either be any value, or the promise for any value.

**Examples**

```javascript

flow(fs, 0).then(console.log); // The sum of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], returns 10
```

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)&lt;any>** The result of applying `x` to the pipeline of
`fs`.

### fold

    over the list. `f` can either be a function, or a promise that resolves to
    a promise. This function can either return a value or the promise for a
    value.
-   `acc` **([Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)&lt;any> | any)** The initial value to apply to the first call

    value. This can either be an array, or the promise for an array.

**Examples**

```javascript
const f = (acc, x) => future(acc + x);
const xs = [...Array(5).keys()];
fold(f, 0, xs).then(console.log); // The sum of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], returns 10;
```

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)&lt;any>** The value of `xs` reduced over `f`.

### whenElse

Make a conditional test and either call the left or the right branch.

**Parameters**

-   `predicate` **[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** Test if a condition is `true` or `false`.
